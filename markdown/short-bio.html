<p>Hello, and welcome to my hub. My name is Mark Doffman and I'm a hacker and developer based in Manchester, UK. I have been working on mobile devices and platforms for seven years, and open source solutions for the past four. The mobile landscape has changed dramatically in that time, unifying devices with the internet, creating fantastic application platforms, and making the use of open-source virtually mandatory. I'm keeping up. I'm always on the lookout for new ideas and exciting technologies.</p>

<p>I have worked on a variety of projects in the past, some of which are showcased on this site. For my employer, <a href="http://codethink.co.uk/">Codethink</a>, I am currently working on the use of RDF and SPARQL with an open-source mobile platform. You can find out more by visiting my blog at <a href="http://doffm.posterous.com/">posterous</a>.</p>

<p>There are many options for you to get in touch with me. As well as the ubiquitous <a href="http://www.facebook.com/mark.doffman">facebook</a>, I'm also available through <a href="http://twitter.com/doffm">twitter</a> and <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/mark-doffman/14/924/204">LinkedIn</a>. If you prefer, you can contact me directly below.</p>

<p>Thanks for looking!</p>
