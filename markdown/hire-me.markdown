I'm currently working for a consultancy called [Codethink](http://www.codethink.co.uk/). Although I may be booked for the foreseeable future, we have a brilliant team of guys with experience in [Linux, GNOME, UI, UX, RDF, MeeGo, Qt](http://www.codethink.co.uk/projects), and a million other technologies. We would love to hear from you, even if its just to pick our brains or discuss the latest hot topic. Contact details are on [Codethinks website](http://www.codethink.co.uk/contact). Be sure to mention me when you call.
