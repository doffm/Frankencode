This site is served using [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/). The design is influenced by the folks at [Analog](http://analog.coop). I used their [hashgrid](http://hashgrid.com/) code to help me lay things out. The contact form was inspired by Analog, but is using [autoresize](http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/jquery-plugin-autoresize/) javascript. [Blueprint](http://www.blueprintcss.org/) CSS is used for the base-line grid and typography.
