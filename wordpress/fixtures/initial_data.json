The purpose of the trip was to hammer out issues with the D-Bus AT-SPI port, so that everyone can feel more confident about its readiness for Gnome 3.0.\r\n\r\nWhat a great week we ended up having. I should first say thanks to all that attended, <a href=\"http://blogs.sun.com/wwalker/\" target=\"_blank\">Willie Walker</a>, <a href=\"http://lightvortex.livejournal.com/\">Mike Gorse</a>, Li Yuan, Ke Wang, <a href=\"http://brad.getcoded.net/blog/index.php\">Brad Taylor</a>, and <a href=\"http://blog.floopily.org/\">Rob Taylor</a>. Sun, Novell &amp; Codethink also need thanking. They paid for everyone to be there, some flying from China, with no foundation money involved. The Gnome community is extremely lucky to have Willie devoting his time to accessibility. I dread to think what Gnome a11y would be like without his organization and direction\r\n\r\nWillie organized the event, I imagine more out of fear at what he found in the D-Bus AT-SPI code-base than anything else. All told I think everyone was pleasantly surprised. The project will take a-lot of work to get to the level of maturity required, but loads has already been done. What is required of us for Gnome 3.0 isn't our of our reach.\r\n\r\nWe started the week with a very brief overview of the design for AT-SPI D-Bus. Only Mike and I had much experience with the project and we wanted to get everyone up to speed.\u00c2\u00a0 This very quickly turned into a Q&amp;A session and we figured out what the main issues were on Monday afternoon. Tuesday was spent on the important task of checking the D-Bus protocol specification against both the code and the IDL spec. This bought up a number of bugs, issues and improvements. It was well worthwhile. Amazingly Wednesday &amp; Thursday were spent hacking by everyone, which is a great feat considering that four of us had only peeked at the code previously. So much got done. Orca is now running with a fair degree of success and we can move on to performance issues and application-specific bugs. For a full run-down of the still-to-dos and what-got-dones take a look at the<a href=\"http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/Accessibility/ATK/AT-SPI/AT-SPI_on_D-Bus/DublinHackfest\"> weeks wiki</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Dublin</strong>\r\n\r\nOutside of work was great fun also. Dublin really is a beautiful city. Lots of green spaces nice buildings and extremely friendly people. The business park is pretty swanky also, and luckily the Oracle buildings are across the road from Sun. We went out to eat and drink in Temple bar, which apparently isn't a bar. Wednesday involved a trip to the very very small Novell offices in Dublin. They are a way out of town, Brad and I were lucky to get there at all given the distinct lack of signs and road-names that have changed since Google scraped them. We met up with <a href=\"http://monotorrent.blogspot.com/\">Alan McGovern</a>, a Moonlight hacker, and along with a meal and a few drinks geeked the night away.\u00c2\u00a0 <a href=\"http://aruiz.typepad.com/\">Alberto Ruiz</a> took us all out for a nice meal on Thursday night. I forget where it was. You'll have to ask him for the recommendation. Later we attended the Sun Pub Quiz. Luckily for me, our arrival was just as the Quiz part was ending. I'm not so good with the questions.\r\n\r\n<strong>Me for 3.0</strong>\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing for 3.0 I hear you ask? I'm sure you didn't but I'm going to blurt it out anyway. I'll be finding time any-where I can to work on D-Bus accessibility. Codethink has already dedicated lots of my time to the project, and there may be a little more in the future. The accessibility plan looks a little sketchy in the <a href=\"http://live.gnome.org/TwoPointTwentyseven\">road-map</a>, but I believe that with some hard work it can become a big success for the big release.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://mark.doffman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/me3.png\" alt=\"Me for 3.0\" />\r\n\r\nAfter ranting about my work I'd love to hear what everyone else us up-to.

'Do-ifying' applications is a fantastic idea. We shouldn't limit ourselves to GTK apps though.\r\n\r\nThe bit that caught my interest was that racarr was thinking of exposing a UI heirarchy over D-Bus to allow Gnome Do to find key-bindings and make them available. I suggested that AT-SPI would be a better way to do this, as all key-bindings are already exposed. I come to no conclusions over whether A11y is the best way. I'm biased. :) It did get me thinking about how A11y technologies could be used to provide general application assistance with Gnome Do.\r\n\r\n<strong>Context sensitive 'Do' commands</strong>\r\n\r\nOrca, the gnome screen reader, uses a11y mainly by responding to 'focus' events which are emitted when input focus moves to a new widget. Gnome Do could use 'focus' events to provide context-sensitive commands. By knowing which application, and which part of an application the user is currently focused on it might be possible to provide a more tailored selection of commands.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the choice of 'Do' commands for each application would depend on finding out what D-Bus interfaces it supports.\r\n\r\n<strong>Application generated 'Do' commands </strong>\r\n\r\nObviously for application generated commands we need methods of exposing these to Gnome Do. My preference would be to do this via D-Bus, which again a11y could help with. All ATs (Assistive technologies) need to know when new accessible applications appear on the desktop. Towards this end, D-Bus AT-SPI has a daemon that acts as an application registry and informs ATs when new applications are added. This registry could be made more generic so that Gnome Do would listen for new applications and register their 'Do' commands when they are started.\r\n\r\nI can't describe the registration interface here. I don't know Gnome Do. I'm imagining a list of actions with a command name and descriptions, but it could well be much much more complicated.\r\n\r\n<strong>Key Bindings</strong>\r\n\r\nAs <a href=\"http://www.hortont.com/racarr/\">racarr</a> suggests, it should be possible to inspect the applications UI hierarchy to find all the key bindings and present them and their descriptions to Gnome Do. GOK, the gnome on screen keyboard, already does something VERY similar to this by inspecting an application and presenting all the actions of the currently focused window in a simple manner. There may be other things we can infer from the UI hierarchy, but I wouldn't want to get too ambitious here.\r\n\r\nI've often thought that a11y technology was under utilized. As applications on our desktop are already merging together a little by providing and accessing more D-Bus services, a11y seems like it could be well placed to enable some really innovate interfaces for the general user. If this happens it could really help experiences for accessibility users too. More bugs fixed, more descriptions added to widgets with key-bindings. :)", "comment_count": 0, "post_type": "post", "pinged": "", "menu_order": 0, "guid": "http://mark.doffman.com/index.php/2009/02/03/do-ifying-gtk-and-other-applications/", "slug": "do-ifying-gtk-and-other-applications", "comment_status": "closed", "category_id": 0}}, {"pk": 24, "model": "wordpress.post", "fields": {"status": "publish", "post_date": "2008-11-26 18:10:54", "password": "", "content_filtered": "", "mime_type": "", "parent": null, "author": 1, "to_ping": "", "title": "Gnome, KDE & Mono A11y", "excerpt": "", "modified": "2008-11-26 18:10:54", "ping_status": "open", "content": "<strong>Congrats Mono A11y </strong>\r\n\r\nMany congratulations to <a href=\"http://automorphic.blogspot.com/2008/11/mono-accessibility-09-released.html\">Mono Accessibility</a>, team for getting their first release out into the open.\u00c2\u00a0 The Mono A11y team must be one of the largest open-source A11y groups out there and I'm really excited about the work they are doing. WinForms and Moonlight are not yet my thing, but if Silverlight takes off the UIA provider they have created will undoubtedly form an essential part of Linux accessibility.\r\n\r\nI don't believe that it will be in the first release, but I'm really keen to see work start on the UIA client library for Mono. C# and Mono sound like a great place for developing new ATs.\r\n\r\n<strong>AT-SPI D-Bus on freedesktop.org</strong>\r\n\r\nFor people who don't know about Gnome accessibility or AT-SPI D-Bus:\r\n<p align=\"left\">AT-SPI D-Bus is a project which aims to use D-Bus instead of ORBit/CORBA as the IPC mechanism for Linux accessibility. For anyone interested in finding out about the Gnome accessibility architecture the <a href=\"http://library.gnome.org/devel/accessibility-devel-guide/nightly/\">developers page</a> has some good information. Oddly enough KDE has a very good <a href=\"http://accessibility.kde.org/developer/atk.php\">Gnome A11y overview</a>, and Sun has a <a href=\"http://www.sun.com/software/star/gnome/accessibility/architecture.xml\">good diagram</a>. Long story short the AT-SPI D-Bus aims to write a new, D-Bus based adapter for ATK, a registry daemon, and client libraries that are API compatible with the existing cspi and pyatspi.</p>\r\nThe project has a new home on the freedesktop.org servers.\r\n\r\nThe code-base exists at:\u00c2\u00a0 git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/at-spi2/at-spi2-core.git.\r\n\r\nWe are keeping a page on the <a href=\"http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/AT-SPI_on_D-Bus\">linux-foundation wiki</a> updated with all our progress. Unfortunately I'd say that the code is not yet ready for a first release. For reasons soon evident the code isn't currently getting the love it deserves. (Help MUCH appreciated)\r\n\r\nThe reason we chose freedesktop.org and the Linux Foundation instead of Gnome hosting is that we wanted to emphasize the cross-desktop possibilities of a D-Bus based accessibility architecture.\r\n\r\n<strong>Gnome, KDE &amp; Mono: How it all fits together</strong>\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://mono-project.com/files/3/37/Architecture.png\">Mono A11y architecture diagram</a> is missing something important that the AT-SPI D-Bus project can add - QT accessibility.\r\n\r\nThe drive to D-Bus accessibility came from ORBit deprecation, the embedded community and an ideal of cross-desktop accessibility. Its the last motive that has me most excited right now. QT currently has a <a href=\"http://labs.trolltech.com/page/Projects/Accessibility/QDBusBridge\">D-Bus framework based heavily off AT-SPI</a>, but unfortunately it has never been taken far enough to be compatible with existing AT-SPI ATs. The reason that the ATK, cspi and pyatspi libraries are not getting my attention right now is that I really want to get started on bringing QT into the mix.\r\n\r\nA QT adapter for AT-SPI D-Bus will certainly round-out the Accessibility infrastructure on Linux. Not being involved in the KDE community I don't have much say on how they do A11y, but I hope to make it as easy as possible for them to choose AT-SPI D-Bus. Along with the Mono work this could mean that QT, GTK, ATK, Winforms &amp; Swing apps are accessible, using the same ATs, in both KDE and Gnome. I think that would be a fantastic achievement. If we work hard enough accessibility could be one of the big success stories of a joint Akademy/Guadec next year.", "comment_count": 4, "post_type": "post", "pinged": "", "menu_order": 0, "guid": "http://mark.doffman.com/index.php/2008/11/26/gnome-kde-mono-a11y/", "slug": "gnome-kde-mono-a11y", "comment_status": "closed", "category_id": 0}}, {"pk": 23, "model": "wordpress.post", "fields": {"status": "publish", "post_date": "2008-11-13 16:05:57", "password": "", "content_filtered": "", "mime_type": "", "parent": null, "author": 1, "to_ping": "", "title": "The book meme", "excerpt": "", "modified": "2008-11-13 16:05:57", "ping_status": "open", "content": "I like this meme, its a fantastic window into how depressingly geeky we all are.\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Grab the nearest book.</li>\r\n\t<li>Open it to page 56.</li>\r\n\t<li>Find the fifth sentence.</li>\r\n\t<li>Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.</li>\r\n\t<li>Don`t dig for your favorite book, the cool book, or the intellectual one: pick the CLOSEST.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<blockquote><strong>\"Some learned people are intelligent.\"</strong></blockquote>\r\nFrom \"Mathematics for the Nonmathematician\" by Morris Kline.

Al on the other hand wanted to make us belive that Norm was a bribe taking crook.\r\n\r\nApparently this was the most expensive senatorial campaign in the country.

I'm very happy to finally have something to show for it.\r\n\r\n<strong> So much to do...</strong>\r\n\r\nWhat we have however isn't quite the finished article. One of the main goals of the project is to help bring together Gnome and KDE accessibility.  I believe that QT already has an ATK implementation, but I think it would make more sense for the QT accessibility interfaces to meet directly with the AT-SPI D-Bus protocol, a project that has not-yet begun.\r\n\r\nOn the ATK-Bridge / Pyatspi side there is still a huge amount of testing and bug fixing to do, along with a fair few missing features.\r\n\r\n<strong> So much to test...</strong>\r\n\r\nIts testing thats really occupying my thoughts at the moment. A while back, on a linux-foundation conference call, I remeber a conversation about how to test the pyatspi and cspi interfaces.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions were:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Have lots of small applications, each exposing only a few accessible objects and concentrating on a single accessible interface, such as the Component or Image interface.</li>\r\n\t<li>Have a unit test written for cspi or pyatspi that is partnered with one of the mini applications, and inspects it over the AT-SPI protocol.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI have made a poor attempt to unit test pyatspi in this way, but I found it was a-lot of work to get any coverage. I think this is down to my choice of implementing a dummy ATK framework to create the applications. Mini GTK applications would have done just as well.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of lots of these mini applications and unit tests is that when someone comes to implement the AT-SPI protocol with a new widget set, or with new client side bindings they have something simple to validate against.\r\n\r\n<strong> Where to go</strong>\r\n\r\nThe repository for the D-Bus AT-SPI work is still on the <a href=\"http://git.codethink.co.uk/?p=atspi-dbus;a=summary\">Codethink servers</a>.

After reading Willie's e-mail though I was firmly in favor.\r\n\r\nHowever Willie stumbled across a possible performance problem when accessibility is turned on. Using gtk-demo to test memory usage 'top' shows that accessibility can increase the 'DATA' memory section by 15mb, or over double the memory consumption. This was pretty shocking to me, so I tried to use massif to find the cause.\r\n\r\nThing is, massif reports that the memory allocation is not greatly increased by turning accessibility on.\u00c2\u00a0 The maximum stack size is not increased either. The 'DATA' field of 'top' apparently reports the DRS, or data resident set. The number of pages used by both the stack and heap. Rob suggested that fragmentation could be the problem, but in general I'm pretty stumped as to what is causing the discrepancy.\r\n\r\n<strong>Help and suggestions greatly appreciated :)</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Conduit conversations</strong>\r\n\r\nWe have <a href=\"http://blogs.gnome.org/johncarr\">John Carr </a>in the office now.

I was treated to a crash course on Conduit internals that left my brain feeling like a squeezed sponge, wrung cloth, and juiced orange all at once. This syncing thing is terribly hard and John has some difficult use cases that he wants to make work. (Tranferring contacts from his laptop go to GMail, and from GMail to the N810 and from that to his laptop. Whew.) Good luck to him. I think its the 'Brain the size of texas' award if he manages it.\r\n\r\n<strong>The rest of the week...</strong>\r\n\r\nRob probably can't blog to tell you this because he is gibbering somewhere in the corner muttering \"Reference, Reference, where art thou?\".

interesting, but it seems to leave out some fairly major features of the RDF approach. It doesn't mention that there are standard ontologies for different subject areas, like the Nepomuk ones that cover the kind of things you find in a personal computer, or FOAF for describing people, or Geonames for geospatial data. These standard ontologies mean that you can easily combine the results of more than one data source, by making 'federated queries'. You can't do that with normal relational databases because there is no standard way of representing the same sort of data in the same way with the same tables, and the data isn't self describing. Hence, the term 'Open Linked Data' for RDF stores which is all about turning the web into one big data warehouse.\r\n\r\nSo to me it is less important that Tracker can support custom ontologies, than it is to be able to make federated queries than combine data in the local Tracker store with databases out on the web, such as DBpedia. SKOS provides a means to describe how one ontology relates to another. Maybe instead of importing data from the web into custom ontologies in a local store, you need something like SKOS definitions to help describe equivalent terms in Nepomuk to ones in web based ontologies to act as a bridge between the local data, and the web based data.", "user_id": 0, "comment_type": "", "author_email": "richard.dale@codethink.co.uk", "author_name": "Richard Dale", "post_date": "2010-04-15 22:06:41", "parent_id": 0, "author_url": "", "agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/4.4; Linux) KHTML/4.4.2 (like Gecko)", "post": 72, "author_ip": "88.24.78.41", "approved": "1", "karma": 0}}, {"pk": 3445, "model": "wordpress.comment", "fields": {"content": "Wow, thanks for the benchmark and work you've put in it.
